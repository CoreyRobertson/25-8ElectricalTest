            <h4>5. HOW WE PROTECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                5.1 We will take reasonable steps to protect the personal information from misuse,
                interference, loss and unauthorised access or disclosure. This may include taking
                reasonable steps to destroy or permanently de-identify personal information once it
                is no longer needed for any purpose for which the information may be used or
                disclosed.
                <br />
                <br />
                5.2 We will not attempt to match de-identified or anonymous data collected through
                surveys or such online devices as &quot;cookies&quot;, with information identifying an
                individual, without the consent of the relevant individual.
                <br />
                <br />
                5.3 We require our employees and contractors to perform their duties in a manner
                that is consistent with our legal responsibilities in relation to privacy, including those
                in this Privacy Policy. We note that we take reasonable steps to ensure that personal
                information is only accessible by people who have a genuine &quot;need to know&quot; as well as &quot;right to know.&quot;
                <br />
                <br />
                5.4 While we try our best to ensure your personal information is protected from loss,
                misuse, unauthorised access, modification or disclosure (via measures such as
                firewalls, data encryption, virus detection methods, and password restricted access),
                we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your personal information (it’s the
                Internet after all). In the event of a data breach, we will attend to the reporting
                requirements that apply to us. We cannot accept responsibility for the misuse, loss
                or unauthorised access to, your personal information where the security of
                information is not within our control.
                <br />
                <br />
                5.5 If you reside in Australia, in the event that there is a data breach and we are
                required to comply with the Notifiable Data Breaches Scheme of the Privacy Act, we
                will take all reasonable steps to contain the suspected or known breach where
                possible. If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the data breach is likely to
                result in serious harm to any individuals involved, then we will take all reasonable
                steps to ensure an assessment is completed within 30 days of the breach or sooner
                if possible. We will follow the guide published by the Office of the Australian
                Information Commissioner (if any) in making this assessment. If we reasonably
                determine that the data breach is not likely to result in serious harm to any
                individuals involved or any remedial action we take is successful in making serious
                harm no longer likely, then no notification or statement will be made.
                <br />
                <br />
                In the case of a personal information breach that affects an individual in the
                European Union, we shall without undue delay and where feasible, not later than 72
                hours after having become aware of the breach, notify you and the Information
                Commissioner’s Office, unless the breach is unlikely to result in a risk to your right
                and privacy.
            </p>
            <h4>6. HOW YOU CAN ACCESS, DELETE OR CORRECT YOUR INFORMATION</h4>
            <p>
                6.1 We will permit records containing your personal information to be accessed by
                you when you contact us c/o the contact details at point 12 below. You may contact
                us or update your settings to correct, delete or update your personal information. We
                may, however, refuse to provide you with access to your personal information if, for
                instance, granting you such access would pose a serious threat to your life or to the
                health and safety of any individual or have an unreasonable impact on the privacy of
                any other individual.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.2 If you believe that personal information we hold about you is incorrect,
                incomplete or inaccurate, then you may request us to amend it. We will consider if
                the information requires amendment. If we do not agree that there are grounds for
                amendment, then we will add a note to the personal information stating that you
                disagree with it.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.3 If you:
            </p>
            <ol type='a'>
                <li>
                    wish to lodge a request to access and/or correct your Personal Information; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    have been refused access to your Personal Information by us for any reason described in this Policy and you wish to challenge that refusal;
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                you may do so by contacting the office of 25/8 Electrical’s Privacy Officer as per the
                details in point 12.  The procedure for challenging such a refusal is also set out in
                point 12.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.4 You may have your information, where technically feasible, sent to another
                organisation, where we hold this information with your consent or for the
                performance of a contract with you.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.5 We will not normally charge a fee for processing an access request unless the
                request is complex or is resource intensive. We do, however, reserve the right to
                charge an administration fee if an individual requests access to their personal
                information more than once in a 3 month period.
                <br />
                <br />
                6.6Where we offer online account management facilities, customers can use this
                capability to control aspects of their account, including amending or updating certain
                personal information.
            </p>
            <h4>7. OPENNESS</h4>
            <p>
                The office of 25/8 Electrical’s Privacy Officer will be the first point of contact for
                inquiries about privacy issues. If you wish to make an inquiry or complaint regarding
                privacy you should do so by contacting this office as per the details in point 12.
            </p>
            <h4>8. STAYING ANONYMOUS</h4>
            <p>
                8.1 We will not make it mandatory for visitors to our website to provide personal
                information unless such information is required to answer an inquiry or provide a
                service. We may, however, request visitors to provide personal information
                voluntarily to us (for example, as part of a competition or questionnaire).
                <br />
                <br />
                8.2 We will allow our customers to transact with us anonymously or by using a
                pseudonym wherever that is reasonable and practicable.
            </p>
            <h4>9. TRANSFERRING INFORMATION OVERSEAS</h4>
            <p>
                9.1 We will only transfer personal information about an individual to someone who is
                in a foreign country if:
            </p>
            <ol type='a'>
                <li>
                    we reasonably believe that the recipient of the information is subject to a law, or binding
                    scheme, which effectively overall upholds principles for protection of the information that
                    are substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles, and there are mechanisms that
                    an individual can access to take action to enforce that law or binding scheme;
                </li>
                <li>
                    we have taken such steps as are reasonable in the circumstances to ensure that the
                    information which it has transferred will not be held, used or disclosed by the recipient of the information inconsistently with the Australian Privacy Principles; or
                </li>
                <li>
                    the individual has been expressly informed that if they consent to the transfer, paragraph 9.1(a) will not apply, and the individual consents to the transfer.
                    <strong> Note: </strong>By engaging us, you consent to the transfer of information to someone who is in a foreign country, even if paragraph 9.1(a) does not apply, in circumstances where:
                </li>
                <ol typeof='i'>
                    <li>
                        we consider that it is necessary for us to do so in order to properly provide you with the
                        required services, including by confirming an appointment or responding to your queries
                        with respect to your engagement of us;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        the transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the individual between us and a third party;
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        all of the following apply:
                    </li>
                    <ol type='A'>
                        <li>the transfer is for the benefit of the individual;</li>
                        <li>it is impracticable to obtain the consent of the individual to that transfer; and</li>
                        <li>if it were practicable to obtain such consent, the individual would be likely to give it.</li>
                    </ol>
                </ol>
            </ol>
            <h4>10. ASSIGNMENT, CHANGE OF CONTROL AND TRANSFER</h4>
            <p>All of our rights and obligations under our Privacy Policy are freely assignable by us
                to any of our affiliates, in connection with a merger, acquisition, restructuring, or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise, and we may transfer your information
                to any of our affiliates, successor entities, or new owner.</p>
            <h4>11. CHANGES TO THE PRIVACY POLICY</h4>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy at any time and from time to time. Any changes
                will be effective when posted on this website. Your continued use of the website will
                indicate your acceptance of any changes to the Privacy Policy. All personal
                information, collected both before and after any changes take effect, will be subject
                to the terms of the revised policy (for which you will be taken to have provided
                consent) unless you indicate otherwise by contacting the office of 25/8 Electrical’
                Privacy Officer as per the details in point 12. We urge you to refer back to this page
                regularly and especially prior to providing us with any personal information.</p>

                Once the Privacy Officer receives a complaint from you, the Privacy Officer will within
                a reasonable time after receiving the complaint begin investigating the complaint. In
                investigating the complaint the officer may use additional resources within our
                organisation to determine the nature of the complaint. We may contact you during
                this investigation if necessary. If a breach is found, the Privacy Officer will escalate
                the matter to management to ensure that the process which caused the breach is
                remedied. We will also contact you to inform you of the outcome of the investigation
                within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the same. We will treat your
                complaint during the investigation period confidentially and aim to resolve your
                complaint in a timely fashion and a satisfactory manner.
                <br />
                <br />
                If you still remain unsatisfied with the way a privacy issue has been handled, you can
                lodge a complaint or contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner.
