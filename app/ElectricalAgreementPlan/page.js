                Safety &amp; Compliance Service (&quot;Scheduled Smoke Alarm Service&quot;) and the
                Guarantee Services (collectively, &quot;Smoke Alarm Services&quot;).

                <br />
                The Service Fee for each Scheduled Smoke Alarm Service is $99 (plus

                Reference to &quot;Smoke Alarm&quot; means collectively, any or all of the following:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    A smoke alarm or detector that is detachable, portable, battery
                    powered smoke alarms (&quot;Wireless Smoke Alarm&quot;);

            </ul>
            <h4>Scheduled Smoke Alarm Service</h4>
            <p>
                For each Property that is enrolled in the Smoke Alarm Services (and is not
                an Excluded Property), we will (subject to fulfilment of your obligations
                under the Terms) ensure that a Scheduled Smoke Alarm Service is carried
                out at least annually, which shall include (but is not necessarily limited to):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conducting an annual maintenance check on each Smoke Alarm,
                    which includes cleaning, running smoke and button tests and
                    checking status relative to each Smoke Alarm&#39;s expiry period;</li>
                <li>
                    Conducting an annual Smoke Alarm battery check for all Smoke
                    Alarms at a Property;
                </li>
                <li>
                    Assessing positioning and functionality of each Smoke Alarm as
                    against requirements at Law and identification of any installed
                    Smoke Alarm that is excess to such requirements (&#39;Excess Smoke
                    Alarm&#39;);
                </li>
                <li>
                    Replacing or rectifying non-compliant, faulty or expired Smoke
                    Alarms (expressly excluding Interconnected Smoke Alarms, Excess
                    Smoke Alarms and Low Voltage Smoke Alarms linked to a fire indication panel).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    In some circumstances, replacing a Wired Smoke
                    Alarm may require a qualified electrician to attend the property.
                    Where this is required, a qualified electrician will be booked to attend
                    to install a replacement at no additional cost to you. Where the Wired
                    Smoke Alarm is non-compliant or faulty, a temporary Wireless Smoke
                    Alarm will be installed close to the position of the faulty Wired Smoke
                    Alarm pending the electrician attendance. In some circumstances,
                    due to its build date, a property may require interconnection of its
                    Smoke Alarms where there are multiple Smoke Alarms at the
                    property. Where the smoke alarms at a property are Interconnected
                    Smoke Alarms, in the event of them being faulty or expired, we will
                    provide a quote for a replacement. Where the property requires an
                    Interconnected Smoke Alarm or Alarms to be installed for the first
                    time, or in place of non-Interconnected Alarms, we will provide a
                    quotation for that installation; and
                </li>
                <li>
                    Creating a report in respect of each Smoke Alarm Service and
                    maintaining a database with date/location stamps of all Smoke
                    Alarms (in accordance with our Privacy Policy). In the event of an
                    incident at a property, digital records are available as an audit trail of
                    the Smoke Alarm Services provided.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Smoke Alarm Guarantee Services</h4>
            <p>
                For each Property that has received the Annual Service (and is not an
                Excluded Property), call out and rectification costs for all Smoke Alarms
                (excluding Interconnected Alarms, Excess Smoke Alarms and FIP Linked
                Smoke Alarms) (&quot;Guarantee Services&quot;) will be provided at no charge to the
                Owner for 12 months following each Scheduled Smoke Alarm Service
                (&quot;Service Guarantee&quot;) provided by us. For the sake of clarity, if a Property is
                or becomes an Excluded Property in respect of the Smoke Alarm Services
                for any reason, the Service Guarantee is void from that date.
            </p>
            <h4>Relocating &amp; Replacing Smoke Alarms</h4>
            <p>
                To be compliant with the Law, there are requirements in relation to the
                positioning of Smoke Alarms in your property. Please note when a Smoke
                Alarm is relocated or replaced, there may be residual damage either from
                the original installation or resulting from the relocation or replacement of
                the Smoke Alarm. Our technicians are not professional painters/plasterers
                but will make reasonable efforts to avoid causing further damage. Damage
                that may have been caused by the original installation or from the
                relocation or replacement can vary due to the type of original Smoke Alarm
                installed, the size of the cable hole and existing paint coverage and there
                may be discolouration from the original Smoke Alarm location or from
                plastering. Where you require repair, a quote for a professional
                plasterer/painter can be provided upon request. Any such work would be at
                your own additional cost.
            </p>
            <h4>Smoke Alarm Services - Exclusions</h4>
            <p>
                In some circumstances, the carrying out of the Smoke Alarm Service may
                uncover the need for asbestos removal by a specialist contractor. Where
                this is required, costs involved in that asbestos removal are expressly
                excluded from our services and will be at your own additional cost.
            </p>
